                        #### Topics
                        Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are poised to serve as a cornerstone of next-generation 6G
                        networks, enabling the realization of 3D Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks (SAGINs). By
                        operating synergistically with terrestrial infrastructure, High-Altitude Platforms (HAPs), and
                        satellites, UAVs will play a pivotal role in achieving seamless 3D wireless connectivity. However,
                        ensuring the safety, efficiency, and trustworthiness of UAV operations remains a critical
                        challenge, particularly in dynamic environments characterized by heterogeneous wireless
                        conditions, signal clutter, coverage variability, and adverse weather.

                        Artificial Intelligence (AI), an inherent component of 6G ecosystems, offers transformative
                        potential to address these challenges. Yet, the opaque decision-making processes of Machine
                        Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models raise concerns about reliability and accountability in
                        safety-critical UAV applications. Explainable AI (XAI) bridges this gap by fostering transparency, interpretability, and actionable insights for network optimization. Through XAI-driven
                        frameworks, UAVs can dynamically synthesize high-resolution geospatial data, network coverage
                        maps, and meteorological forecasts to optimize flight trajectories, enhance situational awareness,
                        and ensure resilient connectivity via interpretable reasoning understandable by human operators.

                        This workshop seeks to advance research at the intersection of AI-enabled 6G architectures and
                        SAGINs, with a focus on UAV-enabled applications. 
                        
                        **We invite innovative contributions addressing,
                        but not limited to, the following topics:**
                        - Reliable UAV navigation in challenging environments;
                        - XAI-driven frameworks for safety and trust in UAV decision-making;
                        - Optimization strategies for SAGIN infrastructures;
                        - Metrics evaluation for trustworthiness and resilience in AI and XAI-empowered SAGIN;
                        - Energy-efficient AI and XAI-driven SAGINs;
                        - Secure and resilient UAV communications;
                        - Interoperability of UAVs in heterogeneous 6G networks and 3D SAGINs;
                        - Ethical and regulatory implications of AI-driven UAV operations;
                        - AI-powered SAGIN traffic management;
                        - Innovative UAV-oriented use cases that demonstrates the effective integration of AI and XAI into 6G networks.

                        By addressing these emerging challenges, the workshop will catalyze discussions on pioneering
                        methodologies, interdisciplinary research directions, and technological breakthroughs to shape
                        the future of intelligent, trustworthy 6G SAGIN ecosystems.
